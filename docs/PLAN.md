# PLANNING PHASE

### User Interface
My vision is having the grid in the center of the view port with settings on all 4 sides of it.  Rough idea for now is:
- Top: Grid line toggle
- Bottom: Grid size
- Left: Color options
- Right: Pen Options

#### Inputs
- Toggle grid line visibility
- Grid line setting from 10x10 to 100x100
- Color Options:
    - Background color: color picker
    - Pen color: color picker
    - Rainbow mode: This looks fun
    - Shading mode: One of the challenges
- Pen Options:
    - Single cell pen
    - Maybe fuzzy Pen if enough time

#### Desired Output
A grid of 'cells' that when the user clicks on are modified to the desired color.  If the user holds the mouse button down and moves the mouse surrounding cells will be colored.
Clicking the right button will have the effect or erasing.
